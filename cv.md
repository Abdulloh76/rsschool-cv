## Summary 

I am interested in web-technologies. Since school time I was really into math, but I was very 
indecisive what job I will work on(choose). I try myself in 2d, 3d graphics (very basics)
but I found programming enjoyable for me. And I found debugging time very interesting: 
when you are looking for problems(errors) in your code; 
you browse your code step by step(area where is the error).

And now my goal is to grow up to junior front-end developer and find a 
job where I will have an interesting tasks ...

Self-motivated, hard-working, interested in details, willing to learn.
